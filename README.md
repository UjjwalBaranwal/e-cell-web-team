# e-cell-web-team

## this is the project given to me by Web-team of E-cell of MNNIT

### the first page was a figma design
i tried my best to copy the figma design , though i put a another version of the toogle/hamburger button
but the first page is near as the given design
i used html grid to do the most of the task in the given design
### the second page is a self-made portfolio landing page
i created a my first portfolio page thanks to this project although this site is not yet responsive i will try to make this responsive in the future

#### the tech stack is used in this is HTML CSS Javascripts
